`setRequestConfiguration` is a function that configures Ad requests and initializes Mobile Ads SDK. You need to call this function before you load any Ads. Generally, you call this function when the root component of your app is mounted.

`setRequestConfiguration` returns `Promise<MediationAdapterStatus[]>` which is each mediation adapter's initialization status.

### Properties

#### `trackingAuthorized`

If you are building for iOS 14 or later, Facebook requires that you explicitly set their Advertising Tracking Enabled flag. Use [react-native-tracking-transparency](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-tracking-transparency) to acquire permission status for tracking, and pass it to `trackingAuthorized` property.
